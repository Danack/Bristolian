### About

What you're looking at is the very start of an attempt to make a communication/collaboration tool that is useful at many different scales of communication.

You may have noticed that online communication is kind of crap. 

The lack of open, collaborative communication methods is probably one of the causes of why UK politics can be quite openly corrupt, and nothing seems to result from it.

#### Tools

This is the set of tools currently planing to be built: 

* Send timely notifications of BCC and WECA meetings so that people can ask relevant questions and make statements.
* Help people draft and chase Freedom of Information requests.
* Create timelines of the sheningans that BCC have undertaken, so that other people can understand what has happened.

The aim of all of these is to help people get involved in putting pressure in the relevant places, to try and improve how Bristol is run, and to give people hope so that they don't feel so helpless. 


### Code of conduct

Short version, any behaviour that prevents people from being able to use this site to do "useful" work is very likely to see someone suspended.

Here is a brief summary of the Code of Conduct in musical form:
