## Context always matters

One thing that unpleasant people do is try to 'win' an argument by demanding either:

i) you use their definition of a word, or
ii) you provide your own definition of a word. 

This is a trap.

Although the meaning of a word can defined precisely for use in a given context, outside of that context, the meaning could be completely different.

Apropos of nothing, I wrote shortly after reading  ["JK Rowling is a bigot"](https://burningbird.net/jk-rowling-is-a-bigot/), which offers a useful suggestion of the terms of "assigned female at birth" "assigned male at birth".

Theyâ€™re inclusive terms that can be used in debates such as those around the right to control our access to abortion, to pregnancy prevention aids, and to healthcare used to treat gender dysphoria.



## Asking for specific context might end in refusal


## Code of conduct.
## Conversation elsewhere.

## Reduces conversation to nothing.
