Q2) This question is related to the "Investment fund programme - Approve the Strategic Outline Case for Western Harbour"

There is an ongoing conversation about what a mass transit system for
Bristol could look like; parts of it might be an underground, parts of
it might be a tram network.

Currently the 'Strategic Outline Case' does not appear to mention the word tram in it at all.

There are very few usable crossings from south to north Bristol. It
would be an incredible tragedy if and when Bristol actually gets around to
building a tram network that we found that the Cumberland Basin
crossing should be a vital part of it, but because the masterplanning
didn't factor that in, it was impossible.

This "masterplan concept report" and "highway alignment feasibility" is going ahead in the last year of the term of office of the Mayor of Bristol. We all know he is very keen on an underground system built, but to most of us that seems unlikely to happen.

Is it possible to either delay this work by a year, or to set a requirement that the "highway alignment feasibility" includes reserving space for tram stops in the work done?

Additionally, please stop calling it the "Western Harbour" it is hugely disrespectful to deliberately use the wrong name of an area of the city.

cheers
