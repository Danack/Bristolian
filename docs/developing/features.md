When you work on a task, you should ask which feature you are working on, if I do not set it in the initial chat.

Each feature should have a file in the directory docs/features.

Each feature file should have a short description of what the feature does, but more importantly, it should list the important files and pieces of codes that are used by a feature.

At the end of each task, I say "Housekeeping". When I say that I want you to check what files were actually touched while we worked on the task, and make sure that all the important ones are listed in the feature file for the feature we were working on.
