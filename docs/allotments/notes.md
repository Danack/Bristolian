# A consultation summary


## How is the consultation going?

It's going poorly. It looks like the allotment officers have been really under resourced, and someone suggested coming up with a lot of new rules to 'make life easier' for them. 

The people who wrote the rules didn't seem to consider whether the rules make sense or who is going to enforce the rules.

My understanding is that there is a large number of responses (some people appear to have sent in at least 6 responses), and it's going to be really hard to pick out a path forward from that deluge.

As well as the consultation not being carried out well, there appear to be some misconceptions in the general approach to proposing new rules.

### Site reps are not enforcers

There appears to be a large disconnect between reality and how BCC is approaching this consultation in that the Site Reps are volunteers not council paid enforcers. 

The people who volunteer as Site Reps are already giving quite a bit of time to help BCC run the allotments. Expecting them to punish people for breaking the rules, when the Site Reps don't necessarily agree with the new rules, is a plan for failure. 

### Allotmenteers were already unhappy

Apparently the allotments are showing symptoms of BCCs financial problems, including:

* paths not being maintained making access to some plots hard.
* sewage leak that destroyed several plots.
* holes in fences.
* deer getting into some allotments.
* the position of people on wait list getting 'lost'. 

During a consultation of how the allotments are operated, BCC should at least attempt to listen to the problems facing allotmenteers. If they don't do that, it makes people feel that BCC only want to solve the problems important to it, and makes people feel ignored.

### Can a single set of rules work across the city?

There are issues with trying to enforce a single set of rules across a city.

* the 'no hedges' is probably sensible for most allotments, but for the more wind-swept allotments, hedges provide a useful windbreak.

* the 'no burning' rule is probably a very sensible rule for some allotments. But for other places, where abandoned plots have become overgrown and need clearing, either the cleared material needs to be recycled through burning, or it would need to be carted off and disposed of.

In general, this attempt of having a very long list of rules, that can only be changed after a consultation, does not sound like a sensible way of managing the allotments or interacting with the allotmenteers.


## Recommendations

I'm not sure if the current consultation can be saved, as it appears to be a "How to get to Dublin?" problem; ‘Well sir, if I were you, I wouldn’t start from here’.

If the consultation was going to be re-run, I would suggest the following steps:

### 1. Talk to the allotment officers

Find out what problems (see below) they are having, other than massive under resourcing, and get those documented in a form that can be read. That will enable a conversation about how to solve those problems, and possible get 'buy-in' from the Allotmenteers.

In particular, there may be a quite severe set of problems that leave a lot of plots 'unused'.

There appear to be cases where the previous tenants have given up/walked away from maintaining a plot, but that plot isn't assigned to someone else for months/years, which leads to a huge cleanup job.

### 2. Talk to the Site Reps

The Site Reps are people who have a lot of experience of what it is actually like to be a plot holder. They are also people who will have a lot of visibility on handling complaints. 

The Council seems to be quite unaware of what their experiences are.

I would expect Site Reps to be able to give really quick feedback to the Allotment Officers of how any problems could be addressed, and feedback about whether particular solutions are likely to be acceptable or not.


### 3. Come up with a new plan

As I mentioned earlier, I don't think the current proposal with a large increase in the length of rules is a great path.

It might be a good idea to see what other Council have as their 'rules' and if any of those are working well, to use that as a starting point.

### 4. Consult with the bulk of allotmenteers slowly

Although some people will always disagree with any rule changes, hopefully if each proposed change is documented with the problem it is meant to be addressing, and the solution proposed is acceptable to Site Reps.

The consultation needs to be done slowly and more iteratively than the current consultation has been done.




## Allotment problems?

So the current proposed rule changes seem to indicate that some people think the items below are problems that need to be solved.

For each of them I think it would help the conversation if these questions were asked:

* What problem are you trying to solve?
* Have you considered
* What other solutions to that problem would be acceptable?
* Is this really a problem that needs to be addressed in the rule book?

### Trees

I can imagine there are problems with large trees causing excessive shade or taking up too much space, however the current proposed rules would require people to remove fruit trees that are producing a lot fruit.

Additionally, it's unclear how easily the rules could be applied. If someone plants a tree of the wrong root stock, how would any Site Rep or Allotment Officer determine if it was the right stock or not?

Finally, the 'approved' root stock is allegedly not very good, and doesn't support healthy trees.


### Wild flowers

The proposed rules seem to contain a crackdown on wild-flowers. I can imagine there could be problems with people allowing plots to get overgrown, and then claiming that it's a deliberate "wild-flower" patch, which could cause a conflict.

Some people would want to allow wild-flower patches to act as a nature reserve for insects that eat pests that affect crops.

### Glass greenhouse

The proposed rules say that only plastic Greenhouses are allowed. I can imagine this is response to an issue with broken glass. However plastic greenhouses aren't very good as they degrade under sunlight and the panels often get blown out.

### Co-workers, sharing plots and other human problems

There appear to be some real problems with people 'sub-letting' their plot, or passing control of their plot to another person, without that person going through the Council managed wait list.

At the same time, it seems the rules for allowing a family or a community group to have communal ownership of a plot are not easy to comply with. It's easy to imagine situations where people who have maintained a plot for years, to lose that plot due to a single person being unwell for a period of time.

There is almost certainly a useful conversation to be had about what rules would prevent people dodging queues, without punishing people who share plots.

### Ponds

Apparently some allotment users like to have ponds. I have no idea what the problems related to those would be, but it seems to be a point of contention.
