# What's been proposed?

To reopen the bottom of University Road to traffic turning in from Queens Road aka the Triangle.

This directive has come directly from the mayor according to a [Freedom of Information request](https://www.bristol247.com/news-and-features/news/mayors-office-want-road-reopened-cars-provide-most-direct-route-drivers/). 

To me, this is a really dumb idea.

## Why is the Labour Mayor proposing this?

Dunno.

My guess is that it's cheaper than converting it to a properly closed off and pedestrianised bit of pavement.

## How to object 

Short version, send an email:

> Objections to the proposal, together with the grounds on which they are made must be 
> sent in writing to TRO Comments at the undermentioned address or by e-mail to
> tro.comments@bristol.gov.uk quoting reference CAE/NMT/P-1262 by 17th May 2023.
>
> Please include your name and address and note that all representations received may be
> considered in public by the City Council and that the substance of any representation
> together with the name and address of the person making it could become available 
> for public inspection. 


## Reasons to object

As well as your name and address, you need to say why you are objecting. I would recommend writing any of the following in your own words:

* The crossing is used by thousands of people an hour[^number_of_pedestrians]. Having cars turn into a road that has a constant stream of people walking across it sounds bad.

* Cyclists, who are still going to be allowed to drive down the road, are going to meet cars head on. That also sounds bad.

* It is in violation of both local and national policy even according to the justifying docs "Whilst it is acknowledged that prioritising motor traffic is not in line/in accordance with current local and national policy/traffic hierarchy"

* Reopening the road doesn't actually help cars get around the city. They can turn into Queen's Avenue to get to Woodland road.

## Full details

The proposal is [here](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/files/documents/6207-notice-of-proposals-p-1262/file), and there are some related documents on [the Bristol City Council site](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/residents/streets-travel/make-a-comment-on-traffic-regulation-orders-tros).

But there is a distinct lack of any explanation or justification for the re-opening.

[^number_of_pedestrians]: I did a count of how many people were crossing the road at 1:20pm on the 2nd of May. It was 330 people in 10 minutes aka 2000 people per hour.
