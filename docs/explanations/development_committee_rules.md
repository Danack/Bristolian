## Summary

* At some point in 2019, the chairs of the Development Committees (Don Alexander and Tom Brook) proposed that there should be a 'cooling off' period when a development committee refuses an application.
* A draft of the [proposed changes can be found here](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s34769/13%20-%20Appendix%202%202.pdf).
* It was proposed to the Audit committee on the 29th July 2019, who said it was a matter for the development committees to decide, so the referred it back.
* A tiny reference to it was made in the agenda item that "Updates member code of conduct" on the 21st May 2020. However that agenda item is missing a clear description of what the change is.

So currently, it is not part of Bristol City Council's constitution both because it wasn't submitted properly, and the constitution wasn't updated, but also because it hasn't been debated or decided by any committee.

The change in 'debate and decision process' is not lawful.

The current rules can be found on page 11 of this part of the constitution [Part 5 (D) Code of conduct for members and officers: planning matters ](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/files/documents/3364-part-5-d-code-of-conduct-for-members-and-officers-planning-matters/file)

The [minutes of this meeting](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s41802/29.7.19.pdf) say that:

> The Committee agreed that it was not the best forum to comment on the proposal.

and 

> That the proposal from the Chairs of the Development Control Committees to amend the Committee Procedure Rules to include a ‘cooling off period’ where the Committee was minded to decide a matter otherwise than in accordance with officer recommendations be referred to Development Control Committee members for consideration.

> I was horrified to see on page 31 that a key measure of success of this administration is the percentage of major applications approved. [(See DGR313a).](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s41563/Performance%20Report%20Quarter%201.pdf)
> Major applications are generally approved by Development Committees which are supposed to be independent decisions taken by Councillors based off independent Officer advice.
> 
> My horror comes from the possibility that this measure is putting Planning Officers in a conflict of interest situation. They are supposed to be assessing whether a development meets planning policy but in the back of their mind they know one of the department’s measures of success and possibly even their own personal objective is influencing them to favour approval over and above the principle of sustainable development.
>
> And what if, for example, a Committee refuses an application and it is taken to appeal by the developer. If officers are measured on approval percentage then how much effort will they put into documents that support the Committee’s decision to refuse. That has to meet the test of potential bias and open the Council up to judicial review
> 
> There are huge amounts of money to be made by YTL, L&G and lots of other developers with so much to gain from “subtle” changes to policy. Indeed some in Bristol would be justified in wondering whether both land and now democracy seems to be being sold off to the highest bidder.

There are three documents for this item:

* [Constitution Update: Members Code of Conduct for Development Control Committees](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s49008/1_Members%20CoC%20for%20DC%20Committees%2013%20FC%20AGM%20report.pdf)

* [Appendix 2 - Good practice protocol for planning](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s49010/3_App2%20-%20DC%20CoC.pdf)

The first document is the overview. It is meant to tell Councillors what the agenda item is about. The vast majority of the document talks about "Member Code of Conduct ", however right at the bottom of the second page, there is a single sentence that refers to "The addition of a new appendix 2 detailing the debate and decision process."

## Questions

### Did any committee approved the alleged changes?

My understanding is that changes to the constitution need to be debated and approved at a committee other than Full Council, before being sent to Full Council for formal agreement.

Did any committee discuss and approve the changes?

Although the Audit Committee said the change was to be referred back to the Development Control Committees, I can't see any meetings where it was formally discussed.

### Did the Monitoring Officer mislead the full council?

Is there a falsehood in [the overview document](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s49008/1_Members%20CoC%20for%20DC%20Committees%2013%20FC%20AGM%20report.pdf):

> The updated Code was considered by the Audit Committee on 16 March 2020 where it was endorsed and recommended to Full Council for adoption.

Although it's true that the updated "Member code of conduct" was discussed at the [Audit Committee on the 16th of March 2020](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=134&MId=5915&Ver=4), that debate did not include any changes in 'debate and decision process'.

### Did someone forget to attach documents?

It seems the intention was to 'slip in' the changes to the 'debate and decision process' at the full council on 21st May 2020, as the overview does say that they should be there

Did the Monitoring Officer simply forget to attach the documents for that particular change?

To be fair, he would have been very busy at the time, as it was the time when the Bristol Energy scandal was being hushed-up, despite [Geoff Gollops best efforts](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s49408/CS03%20-%20Councillor%20Geoff%20Gollop_Redacted.pdf) to shed light on it.

### Have the Officers in BCC's planning department been misled?

In the draft minutes for the [18th October 2023 Development Control B Committee](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s90064/DCB%20Minutes%2018th%20October%202023%20v2%20AH%20Edit.pdf) is this line:

> The Chief Planner and Head of Planning reminded Members that should they be minded to refuse the application, they would need to provide Officers with a steer on the reasons for refusal. Officers could then bring the suggested reasons back to a future Meeting of the Committee for agreement, or for the Committee to reconsider.

I'm sure the Chief Planner and Head of Planning didn't do this intentionally, but they have misled the committee here. Although that might be the common understanding of the rules, those are not actually the rules.

### Were the chairs of DCA and DCB aware?

Both development committees started using the new 'debate and decision process' within three months of the Full Council meeting of the 21st May 2020.

Were the committee chairs aware that the new process hadn't been approved? Were they surprised to see it?
