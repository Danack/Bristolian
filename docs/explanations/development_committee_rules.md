## Summary

* At some point in 2019, the chairs of the Development Committees (Don Alexander and Richard Eddy) proposed that there should be a 'cooling off' period when a development committee refuses an application.
* It was proposed to the Audit committee on the 29th July 2019, who said it was a matter for the development committees to decide, so the referred it back.
* A tiny reference to it was made in the agenda item that "Updates member code of conduct" on the 21st May 2020. However that agenda item is missing a clear description of what the change is.

So currently, it is not part of Bristol City Council's constitution both because it wasn't submitted properly, and the constitution wasn't updated, but also because it hasn't been debated or decided by any committee.

The change in 'debate and decision process' is not lawful.

    The [minutes of this meeting](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s41802/29.7.19.pdf) say that:

> The Committee agreed that it was not the best forum to comment on the proposal.

and 

> That the proposal from the Chairs of the Development Control Committees to amend the Committee Procedure Rules to include a ‘cooling off period’ where the Committee was minded to decide a matter otherwise than in accordance with officer recommendations be referred to Development Control Committee members for consideration.

  The first document is the overview. It is meant to tell Councillors what the agenda item is about. The vast majority of the document talks about "Member Code of Conduct ", however right at the bottom of the second page, there is a single sentence that refers to "The addition of a new appendix 2 detailing the debate and decision process."

## Questions

Is there a falsehood in [the overview document](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s49008/1_Members%20CoC%20for%20DC%20Committees%2013%20FC%20AGM%20report.pdf):

> The updated Code was considered by the Audit Committee on 16 March 2020 where it was endorsed and recommended to Full Council for adoption.

Although it's true that the updated "Member code of conduct" was discussed at the [Audit Committee on the 16th of March 2020](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=134&MId=5915&Ver=4), that debate did not include any changes in 'debate and decision process'.
