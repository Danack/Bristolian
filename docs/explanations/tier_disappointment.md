These issues with Tier still exist in other cities that they've been operating in for years. I've used them in Lyon, Berlin and Munich and in all three cities they still had issues with the kickstands dragging, randomly slowing down when you were anywhere close to a no-ride zone even if you weren't in it, and reporting parking bays as full even when there were only a couple of scooters there.

## Lack of scooters

Voi had 3500 scooters, Tier still have only 1250

## Scooters cutting out dangerously

> Later on and more frustrated I checked the app and it was saying I was in a no-go zone, which was the middle of the river, while I was very much on Coronation Road.


## Can't check battery before ride

The feature I miss from the Voi app was that when you scanned a scooter, it didn't immediately start your ride. You got to see the battery level of the scooter on the app before starting. It made it so easy to go down a line of scooters to find one with a good charge.

Also hate that if you’re on a faulty scooter there’s no option to get off and get on a new one within a minute or two

## Accelerator getting stuck

The accelerator button stuck down multiple times on my journey home tonight, tried to tell Tier after my ride but didn't get an option to.

Yeah this sucks. It's not easy enough to check the battery before it just starts your ride too.

## Can't give feedback at end of ride easily.

Have to hunt for it. "Help & Safety > Help Center > Send us a Message"
