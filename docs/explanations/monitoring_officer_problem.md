# The shenanigans of Bristol City Council's Monitoring Officer


## TL:DR version

So, the situation is a bit complicated, so here is a very simple version.

* Under UK law, Councils are required to appoint 'Independent Persons' who get consulted during the complaints process when members of the public complain about the behaviour of Councillors.
* It is also a legal requirement that the appointment of 'Independent Persons' is ratified by a majority of the members of the Council.
* Bristol City Council has appointed three 'Independent Persons' recently. 
* None of those appointments has come to Full Council to be voted on, so those people have not been appointed lawfully.
* The Monitoring Officer mislead the Values and Ethics committee about this requirement, confidently stating it wasn't needed.
* The Monitoring Officer is refusing to give clear answers about what is going on to the Values & Ethics committee. Some of his answers contradict some of this other answers.
* The Monitoring Officer failed to attend the Values and Ethics committee on the 3rd of November. Members of the public were hoping to put supplementary questions to the Monitoring Officer to explain his contradictory answers.
