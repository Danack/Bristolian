# The shenanigans of Bristol City Council's Monitoring Officer


## TL:DR version

As the situation is a bit complicated, here is a simple version.

* Under UK law, Councils are required to appoint 'Independent Persons' who get consulted during the complaints process when members of the public complain about the behaviour of Councillors.
* It is also a legal requirement that the appointment of 'Independent Persons' is ratified by a majority of the members of the Council.
* Bristol City Council has appointed three 'Independent Persons' recently. They have already been consulted in some of the complaints that have been handled this year. 
* None of those appointments has come to Full Council to be voted on, so those people have not been appointed lawfully.
* Which means that none of the complaints against members made since 2017 have been handled lawfully.
* Anyone who is a Monitoring Officer, has a personal public duty to report any unlawfulness at a Council.
* The current Monitoring Officer is refusing to write that report, which is 'non-feasance in a public office' which is a criminal offence.
* Due to data protection laws, passing personal information to anyone without a lawful basis is unlawful. 

So...yeah, we have 'quite' the situation.


## Evidence

TODO - extract relevant bits from minutes.


## Relevant legislation

There's a couple of bits of UK legislation that are relevant.

### Appointment of Independent Persons 

The [Localism Act 2011](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/section/28/enacted) details the requirements for Councils and other authorities to set up a complaints process to handle complaints about members behaviour. It includes a part that say:

> a person may not be appointed under the provision required by subsection (7) unless the person’s appointment has been approved by a majority of the members of the authority


### Duties of a Monitoring Officer

The [Local Government and Housing Act 1989](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/42/section/5) list the public duties of any person appointed to be a Monitoring Officer.

It includes this part:

> it shall be the duty of a relevant authority’s monitoring officer, if it at any time appears to him that any proposal, decision or omission by the authority, by any committee, or sub-committee of the authority, by any person holding any office or employment under the authority, has given rise to or is likely to or would give rise to—
(a)a contravention by the authority, by any committee, or sub-committee of the authority, by any person holding any office or employment under the authority or by any such joint committee of any enactment or rule of law...to prepare a report to the authority with respect to that proposal, decision or omission.


Which basically says that Monitoring Officer has a public duty to say when the Council either has or will act unlawfully, either through taking some action that is not lawful, or failing to take some action that is mandated to be done.

For example, appointing an Independent Person without getting the approval of majority of members for them.

## Relevant documents

Here are some relevant documents that might help some people understand the situation.

### An example Section 5 report

The only example of a Section 5(2) report that has be found is [from 'Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council'](https://democracy.bcpcouncil.gov.uk/documents/s19638/Report%20Under%20Section%205%20of%20the%20Local%20Government%20and%20Houisng%20Act%201989.pdf).

One part of it gives legal opinion of whether these types of report are 'optional':

> Under Section 5(2) of the Local Government Act 1989 the Council’s Monitoring Officer is under a duty to report to Council, if it at any time it appears to her that any proposal, decision or omission on behalf of the Authority has given rise to or is likely to or would give rise to a contravention of any enactment or rule of law.
> 
> This provision does not give the Monitoring Officer any discretion and requires the reporting of the smallest, most inconsequential breaches of legislation, including those that cannot be remedied and for which the impact is small."

### The last known appointment of Independent Person at BCC

The last time that the appointment of an Independent Person was ratified was at [Full Council 10th september 2013](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/Data/Full%20Council/201309101800/Agenda/0910_9e.pdf). From that agenda item:

> "Interviews for a position of “Independent Member (Standards)” of the Audit Committee were undertaken on 10 May by representatives of the Audit Committee and Officers and it was decided to appoint Mr Christopher Eskell to the position."

It's worth noting that the agenda item "Appointment of Independent Persons" listed for the [Full Council meeting on the 14th of November](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s89580/FC%20Report%20-%20IP%20Appointment.pdf) does not include any mention of the proposed Independent Persons being interview by a committee, so that would be a change in Council Policy.

## Spare words

These should fit in somewhere eventually...

* The Monitoring Officer mislead the Values and Ethics committee about this requirement, confidently stating it wasn't needed.
* The Monitoring Officer is refusing to give clear answers about what is going on to the Values & Ethics committee. Some of his answers contradict some of this other answers.
* The Monitoring Officer failed to attend the Values and Ethics committee on the 3rd of November. Members of the public were hoping to put supplementary questions to the Monitoring Officer to explain his contradictory answers.
