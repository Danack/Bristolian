The first is the central hangar - a 17,080 capacity arena auditorium which will host live music, sporting events and comedy shows. Also on the ground floor there will be the Runway Bar, covering the entire width of the hangar with capacity for 3,000 people.


The other issue stopping progress with the build is that YTL is struggling to agree a deal with Network Rail to build the proposed pedestrian bridge over their railway line to link the hanger/arena to the proposed visitor car park on the old airfield site.
Without either of these, there will be no arena.


Well, at least one thing is clear. YTL Developments are at least consistent in not being straightforward in either their non update updates or programme slippage.
