# Some notes on excluding members of the public

So, currently some members of the public have been 'banned' from the City Hall and from attending meetings.

Below are not particularly well structured notes. If you want to, I'd suggest skipping to the last section.

## What case law have been quoted?

From a FOI request for [Law or legislation that supports banning members of the Public from Council meetings.](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/law_or_legislation_that_supports?unfold=1)

> The following case law confirms that local authorities have a common law power to exclude people whose disorderly conduct or other misbehaviour disrupts (or threatens to disrupt) the business of the meeting and that the power can be used either in advance of the meeting or at the meeting itself:-

> • Appleby v United Kingdom;
> • Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of Tenby v Mason;
> • Jane Laporte, Nicolas Christian v The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis
> • Regina v Brent Health Authority, Ex parte Francis.


### Appleby v United Kingdom;

Link that summarises [it is here](https://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Appleby_v_UK).

> In the case of Appleby, the ECtHR held that the free expression and free assembly rights of the Applicants had not been breached when they were refused permission to campaign and collect signatures in a privately-owned town centre.

aka people can be kicked off private land, which is not applicable to banning people from council meetings.

### Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of Tenby v Mason - 1907

Found at bottom [middle of this page](https://papuraunewydd.llyfrgell.cymru/view/4184001/4184005)

A better copy might [be available here,](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C10020031), but that is in the Kew archive and is not currently online. 

This case is from 1907.

> He said he was entitled to attend as a burgees and as a. reporter. It was said that it had been the practice of the council to admit reporters, and that was true, but he failed to see how any right could be vested in that. The defendant thee claimed to be entitled to attend meetings of the council as one of the public. He could not deduce from the law any intention on the part of the legislature that the public should have the right to be admitted to the meetings. Plaintiffs succeeded in their contention that they had the right to exclude the defendant from the meetings of the council, and they were entitled to an injunction.

I don't think this case is relevant.

### Jane Laporte, Nicolas Christian v The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis

This case is from February 2011. Councils are required by law to set a budget by a certain time. In 2011, Haringey Council was 'occupied' by people trying to present the Council from setting a budget.

A video of the [confrontation is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUp7Sjv3tU&ab_channel=ReelNews).

Detailed report is [here](https://vlex.co.uk/vid/1-jane-laporte-and-793034921) though I don't have access to all of it

Although this case probably shows people can be excluded if their aim is to prevent the Council meeting from proceeding, that's probably not completely relevant, as 


### Regina v Brent Health Authority, Ex parte Francis 1985 Q.B. 869

This is not currently available online without paying. I'll try to upload a copy soon, but it can be found in the book "Halsbury's Laws of England: Volume 61, International Relations Law, Judicial Review, Juries, Landfill Tax, 2010 Fifth Edition Hardcover – 1 Jan. 2010"

This case is an application for a Judicial review of whether the decisions taken at a meeting were unlawful, due to members of the public being excluded from the meeting.

It seems to be the case-law that most authorities are using to exclude people from meetings, and probably the one case that needs most studying.

The ruling is surprisingly clear for a judicial review:

> When Parliament passed the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960 they had assumed, and had every right to assume, that if the public were granted admission to meetings of public bodies the public would behave themselves. The purpose of giving the public the right to attend meetings is so that they can inform themselves of what is going on. They are not given the right to disrupt meetings and, of course, the right is not a right to participate in anything that is going on, but merely to observe and hear what is going on. It is since 1960 that the all too prevalent habit has grown up of political opponents of one kind or another getting their supporters to descend on public meetings to disrupt them by rowdy and noisy behaviour, and shouting down all the arguments which the opponents do not wish to hear. I have come to the conclusion that there simply must exist such a common law power. If this statutory body has a duty to perform, it must perform its duty. If it becomes apparent that it cannot perform its duty without excluding the public then, it seems to me, there is a general power such as that referred to by Sir James Colvile in Doyle v. Falconer, L.R. 1 P.C. 328, to exclude the public despite the other words of section 1 of the Act of 1960. Of course, as far as the requirements of public notice and so on are concerned, those only apply to a meeting of a body required by this Act to be open to the public. If the power exists to exclude the public, and it was rightly exercised on this occasion, it is not a meeting of a body required by this Act to be open to the public. It falls within the exception, and notice and so on is not in my view necessary. But that such a power does exist seems to me without question.

Or to put simply, yes, authorities have the power to exclude people if otherwise the public meeting is going to be disrupted.

But the Judge did not explore what the limits of that power might be. There's other cases since then, where people have complained that the were excluded unlawfully.

For example in "Regina (OConnor and another) v Aldershot Magistrates Court" people asked for a Judicial review after they were excluded from attending a court hearing as a member of public, when the court manager (a member of staff, not a judge) decided they should be excluded. The Judicial review found that it was not proper for them to be excluded like that, but could have been if they were excluded by a Justice.


## Summary

1. Councils do have the power to exclude people.
2. It's really not obvious that all four of the people who were excluded should have been, as there wasn't an analysis of each of their actions or motivations.
3. Trying to challenge that would lead to lots of letters being written, and the end result is likely to be, "go ahead and apply for a Judicial review", which would take a lot of time and money.
4. For those who were seeking to de-escalate the situation, getting the lawyer to draft a nice letter saying that and asking to be allowed other council meetings might be an idea?
