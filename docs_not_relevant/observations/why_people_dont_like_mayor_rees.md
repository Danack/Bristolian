## Brislington Meadows

In the most recent election, he stood at the top of brislington meadows with a Twitter post that said " we will keep brislington meadows as a green space" after locals were fighting to keep property developers off the space.

Once he got elected in? Turns out he didn't have the authority to make that quote and they have started exploratory ground works in prep to get the place dug up. He didn't even speak to homes England (the people who the council had sold the ground to originally for 15m) before making the announcement..
