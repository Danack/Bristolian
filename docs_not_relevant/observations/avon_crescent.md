There are therefore no longer the funds available in order to deliver the scheme at Avon Crescent in the form it was previously thought. The revised
scheme is considered to meet the key objectives and impact of the original scheme but now lacks the more expensive palate of materials and the extra
trees that were proposed. This is a reflection of the budgetary constraints.






Liberal Democrat Councillor Alex Hartley announced he was resigning in a letter to residents on Friday, December

While this road has been closed it has been very difficult to move boats from the Allaboard site on Baltic Wharf to our repair shed on Avon Quay. Sometimes this has been possible using a hand trailer via Underfall Yard (now closed indefinitely) or on a vehicle towed trailer via the City centre or Hotwells (adding to congestion and pollution in those areas). If this road is to remain closed there needs to be access for boat trailers between Avon Quay and Baltic Wharf.



1/1 A thread about how a mayor doesn't listen to communities and elected councillors. In 2013 residents were summoned to the Nova Scotia to be told by
@metrobusBristol
that a shared space would be built at Avon Crescent to make for safe access and to mitigate heritage damage.

2/1 residents said why don't you re-route motor traffic in *both* directions rather than just the proposed westbound direction, and started a petition which got 4,273 signatures over a couple of wet winter months.

AVTM development control committee in March 2014, and officers were asked to report back to the committee on the feasibility of re-routing in both directions. Consent was given for the shared space scheme, and officers

4/1 reported back two months later that two-way re-routing was feasible subject to funding. A well-attended meeting was held at the Create Centre on Bonfire night, and the cabinet member for transport and councillors sugested applying to Neighbourhood Forum for C.I.L. funding

5/1 residents attended and advocated for £50,000 C.I.L. which councillors awarded towards the total (at the time) £130,000 cost. Consequently a rerouting consultation was brought forward in Septemebr 2016, just after Marvin's election!

7/1 In October things became a little clearer when Marvin unilaterally announced 'Western Harbour' out of the blue.
3,500 highrise flats were to be built at Cumberland Basin and south of the river on Ashton Meadows and Greville Smythe Park.

8/1 A Western Harbour Advisory Group was set up with John Savage as chair and James Durie and Kevin Slocombe as members, along with some 'usual suspect' Marvin chums, including his church pastors. Not one local councillor was invited. Although this scheme has massive implications

9/1 ARUP did a feasibility study which the community was not allowed to see, until another petition finally forced its disclosure. There were only three options that the Mayor would consider. A new dual carriageway from the Pumphouse pub to

12/1 unlawfully, as the shared space scheme should have been enforced, as it would have been against a private developer (I hope) So this is the city mayor system in action at the grassroots #ScraptheMayor
