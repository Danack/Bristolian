Refused to create a cabinet comprising both green and labour councillors, despite there being an equal number of them in the city.

  This is the one that pushed me over the edge. Just because he didn't need to make sure his cabinet was representative of the wider council doesn't mean it wasn't worth doing. It felt like a blatant attempt to retain power for his team instead of putting Bristol's wants first.

  For sure. Mostly for me it highlighted how unaccountable the mayor is, which made me worry about what other BS could happen in the future.


# Building flats on parks.

    The whole castle park thing was a joke, especially after his "green space" initiative

    Knocking down the flyover and building flats on the park by The Cut in Ashton is properly nuts.

  Of course he knew, plenty of people pointed out at the time the land had already been sold to Homes England by that point and so obviously the council had no power over what was done with it.

Homes England's response about 'working with all parties to find a way forward' was pretty much just a purdah friendly way of saying 'no chance'.

  And the exclusive riverside developments that are covered by an NDA but will involve crippling bristol commuters even more and the m5 holiday overspill in the summer.





  Was 'forced' to take a significant payrise during the middle of furlough.

  Has a 'spiritual advisor' on his staff.

  Grants use of council buildings to churches of his personal faith to the expense of other projects, programs and organisations.

  Holds multiple paid jobs.

    Yeah i thought there was some religious influence to his leadership


Spiritual advisor? This is so weird but seems like there are some very religiously motivated moral things he's pursuing (e.g. closing the strip clubs with very little consultation of those working in them) so not surprising that there's some religious influence going on.

  that there's some religious influence going on.

  It's not a small influence - he has a long history of working for Christian causes:

  "Aside from politics, Christianity has been a running theme in Rees’ life. His first job was working as a youth coordinator with Tearfund, a Christian anti-poverty charity, where he spent two years.

He then spent a year on Sojourners, a Christian social justice magazine and organisation which is based out of Washington DC.

While in America he completed a masters degree in global economic development at Eastern University, a Christian university in Pennsylvania where he studied courses including biblical economics."

And the exact details of his personal religous advisor being employed by BCC are not clear, the same as many of the unminuted meetings are.

His explicit asking of Christian churches for how the city should be run is probably worth noting: https://www.together4bristol.org.uk/Articles/452016/Together_for_Bristol.aspx

The Church needs to describe what the good Bristol would be.

Without a vision the people perish. We must contend for the vision of/for Bristol. There is an opportunity for the church to describe the City we want to be. A clear description of the good society is an essential part of a functioning society but is lacking for Bristol. Rather, what we have at best is a piecemeal approach built around progress of individual issues but with no sense of the whole collective story. At worst we have a vacuum which is filled by the collection of selfish individual visions which crowd out any space for describing a common good that is any more sophisticated than an aspiration of generic economic growth.

Describing the good Bristol is part of describing its purpose which should be language the church is very familiar with: what would a good Bristol look, feel and sound like? How would it work? Where would it be heading? The church’s offer would be just that, an offer, not a diktat. But it would offer a framework through which the city could set priorities, make decisions and judge policy. The theologian Paul Tilich, I am told, warns power abhors a vacuum. If we do not offer a description of the good society, something else will and there will be some other framework for setting and assessing city policy and strategy.


  This too https://medium.com/p/who-is-marvin-rees-faith-adviser-and-what-effect-does-she-have-on-him-3fd67c3737d2

  100% he is not politically motivated. He's know as 'reverend rees'

    Why are there so many religious politicians?




Campaigned on keeping the Brislington meadows from being developed, stood in front of a massive banner saying "save the meadows" and promised he'd stop any development.

Then got elected, turns out he didn't have the power to stop homes England from building on it. Plans go through and exploratory ground samples begin.

He then claims it's unfortunate but it's out of his hands. he literally campaigned on a lie, but was he held accountable? Well now he has.

Of course he knew, plenty of people pointed out at the time the land had already been sold to Homes England by that point and so obviously the council had no power over what was done with it.

Homes England's response about 'working with all parties to find a way forward' was pretty much just a purdah friendly way of saying 'no chance'.



 


Undoubtedly some were confused about it. The council should have sent out the usual election leaflet explaining what the vote was about, the two options and a page each from the two campaigns. The buck of why that wasn't done has to stop with Rees since he has executive power.


All the stadium crap.

Chatting bollocks about an underground.

There's even some video posted here before of how utterly rude and bullish he is to others during meetings and discussions. He's a really horrible person.

Pissed away £3k a month to see what people were saying about him on twitter

Just encapsulated some of the worst aspects of politicians and what can go wrong if you've got a mayor.

I think my biggest impression of him was how much of a dick he was in meetings to people like campaigners (I think it was Carla Denyer pre-Greens leadership) and one of the local democracy reporters.

Took massive objection to an article about a tip. He took the Journo to task, singling them out and saying (I’m paraphrasing) ‘it’s not a tip, it’s not a dump, it’s a household waste recycling centre and is a critical service that shouldn’t be denigrated with that kind of language.’

How does the council website refer to the place? As a tip.

What a blowhard and bully.

Edit- I do think he had good intentions and did some good things too (clean energy investment that is still tbc if it’s effective, admittedly), but I think his ‘with me or against me’ personality has been his downfall


He spent a stupid amount of money monitoring his own presence on Twitter, and responded to criticism with authoritarianism.

Oh, and reducing the Bear Pit to some anonymous, white chrome inner-city wasteland. It needed fixing, but bloody hell...



Tried to close the strip clubs without talking to or listening to the women who work there, at all. Flagrantly ignoring them and making up stats about sexual assaults.

  This one left a particularly nasty taste, it was his strange religious moral campaign rather than any real desire to do actual good or care about the people who work in those industries.



it was his strange religious moral campaign

I suspect there's a touch of this in the arena decision.

I would really love someone to ask him (as if he'd give a straight answer) if he cancelled the arena in the city centre because he didn't think the council should be involved with helping young people going out and enjoying themselves at night with music and drink.


Probably thought it would win votes.

That's somehow even worse, trying to keep his job by forcing a bunch of other people out of work.

On that note, does anyone know if Bristol Women's Voice or website actually talks to women in Bristol?

This group is funded by the council, and the council in turn then appear to use them as part of their justification for decisions.....but it's not obvious to me if this is a real group, or just a front for laundering already made decisions.

... the latter. It's the same old suspects, too. Including a fine selection of TERFs & SWERFs, and predominantly WASPs, too.


"The council should engage more with women!"

"...no, not those women..."

Yeah, there's quite a bit of (small c) conservatism within the Labour Party, they also turned The Bear Pit into The Bare Pit.

There was also the speed limit "consultation" that was a box ticking exorcise that even ignored 2 roads that has seen speeds increase.


Absolutely this. His disregard for women’s opinions, both on this matter and his fellow councillors was shocking. He avoided debating Colston’s statue removal when he first came to office also, knowing it was a contentious issue ( which may have cost him votes ). All councils waste money, but his was astronomical. His avoidance for the clean air zone was bewildered too. He’s achieved nothing of significant benefit considering his time and money spent. I can’t work out whether he was corrupt or incompetent, but he was certainly a self promoting egotistical bully. His legacy is that the office of mayor has been removed, which must haunt him.

When someone says they represent the Labour Party and then enacts policies that put people out of work, I spy a Tory in a red tie.

I honestly think this is one of my biggest issues with him. Sure the arena and "social media research" bullshit has been awful, but the strip clubs fiasco let's me actually know what he's like as a person.

And it let's me know that he's incredibly ill informed in matters of sexism, and will happily make up bullshit to cover his ignorance. Not characteristics you want from a leader.


Inherited a load of debt from the previous mayor, fucked around with the stadium, sold land to the Bristol Uni’s for more student accommodation, instead of building family homes, the vanity project that is that tower of monstrosity on the edge of Castle Park and didn’t fix the roads. I think.

HE DIDN'T FIX THE ROAD????

Seriously though. It would have taken 10 years council budge at once to fix our roads.

Someone a bit more enlightened might have taken the once in a lifetime opportunity to repair all the busy difficult junctions and roundabouts while the roads were completely empty for 6 months, it would have saved a fortune.

Mate, have you seen how councils work? Pretty sure it'd take em 6 months to file the paperwork in order to have a bowel movement let alone do anything useful.

But yeah that would have good.


Yeah, but wasn't the point of having a mayor in the first place to cut through all that crap?

He did fuck all and he did a lot of it.

Dodgy development deals (Western Harbour/Bris Meadows), Bristol Energy waste, the arena fiasco, social media “research” and not only refusing to work cross-party (despite promises of a rainbow cabinet) but generally just displaying open contempt towards elected Councillors at meetings.

He essentially showcased the very worst elements of a flawed mayoral system that should have never been implemented in the first place: bulldozing through his own ideas, conspiring with industry elites without consulting residents or their representatives and believing he and his ideas were above scrutiny.

He was just like, kindof an arsehole.

I distinctly remember going to one of the council meetings and a lady (a doctor IIRC) had gone to the effort of putting in a question to the Mayor, and taking time out of her day to ask it in council. It was something fairly mild about what the Council was doing about airport expansion and climate issues

And Marvin just tore into her. Completely avoided the question but just ripped into her saying something like NHS (and staff & patients travelling to hospital)was the biggest green-house gas emitters in the city and that she 'need to get her own house in order' before coming to him with problems.

He properly humilated this poor woman in front of the whole council, without her having an opportunity to respond. I really couldn't beleive it. So much for being a representative democracy if anyone who does try to engage gets berated like that.

I don't have a lot to say about Marvin's political record, he's done a lot of good things and he's made some very shitty calls. That's just politics. No-one has a flawless record. But he did bring the referendum on himself by just being kindof a t**t.


[–]techie_boy69 1 point 22 days ago
Fair play to him with his jobs and tidy income gotta spend it on something.

https://www.bristol247.com/opinion/your-say/bristol-needs-to-have-a-mayor-but-not-one-who-has-two-second-jobs/

You don't know many sneaker heads

The doesn’t actually listen to people.

He appears to hate south Bristol and has made a pigs ear of a number of bad planning and transport proposals.

He’s failed to take on First Bus and allowed them to cut essential services.

He’s a bit of a plonker!!

As it not been mentioned his complete inability to take ownership of anything.

For example in response to Bristol voting to get rid of the mayor position "its not about me" ...no it absolutely is if the two mayor we had were actually any good and benefited Bristol we would want to keep it.

Instead we had a pair if inept money wasters with questionable morals (not much different to most elected officials I know) but the point remains he was so bad at his job we voted to get rid of the job to prevent this happening again!!

Wasn’t there a rumour that he went on a funded trip courtesy of the people bidding for the arena to be in South Glos rather than near temple meads… Then all of a sudden the temple meads option wasn’t viable?

Also, underground from Bristol to the airport? The M buses are fantastic, absolutely no need for a train. Far better things to spend the money on.

Clean Air zone is needed but poorly thought out. M32 and Portway are the arteries to the city. If you’re going to make them inaccessible, give visitors an alternative

Worth stating I voted to keep the mayor as I believe more democratic and a greater chance for an independent


Wasn’t even a rumour, his trip to YTL has been confirmed but he claims it had no influence on his decision.


Wouldn’t surprise me if he went off to work for YTL after the mayoral stint ends


Strip clubs.. what was this need? It was representing his views not that of Bristol and potentially pushing people into unregulated danger. Then the previous mayor fucking up the stadium and wasting money.


Bit of a read but this gives some pretty good reasons: http://bristolcommentary.uk/bristol-is-now-the-uks-leader-in-authoritarian-democracy

Western Harbour. One of Bristol's best green spaces, enjoyed by thousands of local people, sold off to tory developers to build exorbitant flats with a nice view for the 1%

Hang on is that still happening??

The consultation ended a couple of weeks ago so it's very much still in the pipeline.

Wouldn't mind it if he bothered to fix the other side of the road thats slowly slipping into the water....


He was (is) arrogant and totally incapable of listening to others. Look up how he treated questions from councilors and the public or how he shut down criticism on Twitter. Completely out of step with people and this is supposed to be a for the people Labour mayor. Disgraceful.

Personally, even if you can stomach his shitty attitude, I dislike him because he's thrown away millions of our pounds on wasteful projects that have been utterly mismanaged for example the building and planning of the Bristol arena after some questionable deals he made in private to a construction firm or the huge payouts to his mates for providing fuck all services to the council.

I want my local services properly run like a basic street sweeping service. Have you noticed the amount of litter just fucking everywhere in Bristol? He can't even sort that out but he can find money to spend on vanity projects that benefit nobody but himself.

The bus gate and the deliberate hard to see road signs, all whilst racking up a fair bit of money in the process.

He condemened the "Kill the Bill protestors" based on what Avon & Somerset police said they'd done, and then didn't correct himself when it turned out that the police were lying.

He called the toppling of Colston statue as Performance activism, didn't speak against the prosecution of those who were prosecuted, and is now taking credit for the toppling as part of his "putting Bristol on the map". He should have been the one leading the charge for the statue coming down, but he didn't want 'to waste political capital on the issue'.

Everytime someone criticised him for any of his actions or inactions, he always takes it as a personal insult and inflames the situation. I don't have it to hand, but his petulance and annoyance when the Green's tried to alter his proposed budget to fund the re-opening of public toilets shows a completely wrong temperment for someone to be in power. But this is an example:

Bristol's Mayor has said to suggest there was inaction over the Edward Colston statue would be "mischievous" as he insisted he has been "on the front foot" of tackling issues driving racism in the city.

He said "things have happened in the city" to tackle racism, including the renaming of Colston Hall.

"That's a massive event but it hasn't got much attention because it didn't happen in such a spectacular way," he said.

That is a misrepresentation. The renaming only happened due to the statue being toppled, not because of Mayor Ree's 'leadership'. And he's criticising them for doing something that should have been done by him years ago.

He cancelled the Creative Youth Network which stopped 5 million quid of funding coming from the National Lottery and WECA. The only apparent reason for this is spite; the project was being led by an ex-Green politician, and having that project go forward would be a 'win' for them.....and the young people it was going to help.

But yeah, the moving of the arena to South Gloucester, and the huge financial gift to property developers that went with that, is the main one. That's damaged the city for decades to come.

That one person can do so much damage, despite huge opposition from the public and the other elected people on the council, shows that the way the mayors office is setup is fundamentally bad.

All of this. He seems to be very much in the pocket of the Merchant Venturers from the way he handled the Colston statue being toppled. Almost makes you wonder if he was planning to put it back up again to keep them happy.

 

[–]DJRoach 2 points 21 days ago
Renaming of Colston Hall was a condition for Arts Council funding. That’s the only reason they did it.

Oh, got a link for that? That's probably worth documenting before he writes his memoir.

Hi Marvin. How much are you paying for this Reddit consultation?
