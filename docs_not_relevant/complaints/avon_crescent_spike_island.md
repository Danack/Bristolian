# Avon Crescent planning F.A.Q.

In 2013 planning permission was given to build a MetroBus lane on Spike Island.

Although everyone knows that better transport is needed, this did quite a bit of harm to Spike Island by removing a lot of trees, and concreting over even more of the land.

As parts of the planning conditions for MetroBus

## Tree planting

The trees that were removed were meant to be planted elsewhere.

This has not happened.

## Traffic calming

Avon Crescent was meant to have the road changed to be a shared space, with traffic calming measures to prevent people driving at high speed.

This has just not happened and the council proposed just reopening the road with no traffic changes.

So not only has an area of Bristol been harmed by having more of the land concreted over, the planning conditions that were meant to mitigate that damage haven't been done.

## Isn't the road just going back to how it use to be? What's the problem?

Since the road has been closed for many years, more and more people have started using it as a walking and cycling route.

Re-opening Avon Crescent to cars would make it much less safe for both cyclists and pedestrians. 

Not only is that dangerous and likely to lead to an 'accident', but it would make people less likely to walk or cycle.

Bristol desperately needs to encourage more walking and cycling as currently there are too many cars on Bristol's roads, and that is causing large amounts of pollution and congetstion.

## Did Mayor Rees say that Avon Crescent was going to re-open?

Although Mayor Rees was asked clearly if Avon Crescent was going to re-open, his response is quite ambiguous.

Metrobus did a lot of environmental damage in a conservation area next to heritage assets. Shared space and tree replacement were intended mitigations to get the planning application passed in 2014. Now there is an application to do no mitigation at all 22/05943/X
