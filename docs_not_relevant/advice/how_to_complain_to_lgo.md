I can't remember if I said this elsewhere, but one thing that Clive Stevens said is to avoid including any extra 'complaint" in the complaint to the LGO about how your complaints have been handled.

They will only look at whether BCC only followed their own complaints process properly, not whether the complaint process is good or lawful.
