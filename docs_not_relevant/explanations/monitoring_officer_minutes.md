Supplementary Question – Mike Oldreive – ‘Have all requirements of Section 28 of the Localism Act 2011
been met?’

The Chair asked the MO to respond. The MO stated that Independent members were appointed by the
MO and Head of Legal Services and there was no requirement in the legislation stating that the
appointment was made by Full Council. Independent Members sat on Audit Committee and the Council’s
Shareholder Group and they were appointed by Officers. *

1. Who is the 'independent person' invited to give their views prior to the initial assessment being finalised? In the interests of transparency, this person or at least their post should be identified.

Response:
The Council has appointed 3 Independent Persons from outside the Council to assist the Monitoring Officer in considering complaints. This is statutory requirement under S28 of the Localism Act 2011.

3. I am aware that where one informal resolution recommended the member apologise to a member of the public, no apology has ever been given. As well as a column explaining the decision, should there be a column indicating if the proposed resolution was completed e.g. training undertaken, apology given.

Response:
   The purpose of the report is to provide a summary of complaints only. It would not be appropriate to disclose any further details, to ensure fairness to the complainant and the councillor that is the subject of the complaint.

# Question 5
How should the people of Bristol have confidence that the 'independent person(s)' will act in the interests of the people of Bristol, and not favour avoiding scandals?

I realise that it would not be reasonable to publish their names, but at the same time, what is to prevent the monitoring officer from choosing someone who wouldn't be able to provide an independent point of view? More fundamentally, how do we even know they exist or are consulted during complaints?

The Council has appointed 3 Independent Persons from outside the Council to assist the Monitoring Officer in considering complaints. It is statutory requirement under S28 of the Localism Act 2011 to appoint at least 1 Independent person.


Mike Oldreive
8. What procedures are in place to ensure that actions agreed as part of "informal resolution" take place? How are they followed up by the MO and what happens if the member involved does not comply? [the policy does not explain this]
   A decision notice will set out any action that a member needs to take following a complaint and this will be followed up as appropriate by the Monitoring Officer.


11. Para 7 "no complaints have been upheld during this time". How does this wording fit with the Council's policy and LGA guidance? Does the HOLS mean that "no complaints have been investigated..."?
    To clarify, no complaints have been referred for investigation.


13. Were members of V&E aware of this? Why is the MO withholding key information, including poor performance, from Members?
    The LGO decision is publicly available.

14. Why has the LGO complaint & findings (and any others) not been reported to V&E along with the other information on member complaints in the HOLS report?

A summary of LGO decisions is made available to the Council on an annual basis and this is reported to the Audit Committee and Full Council. It is not within the Terms of Reference of the V&E Sub-committee.

15. Is the identity of the IP kept confidential? How does this square with transparency?
    To ensure the integrity of the complaints procedures, the identify of the Independent Persons is kept confidential.

17. How is V&E committee involved in appointment of IPs? Is this purely the decision of the MO?
    The appointment of the Independent Persons is carried out by the Monitoring Officer and the Head of Legal Services.

23. The BCC revised policy refers to a public interest test. Is there a "public interest" test and where is this documented?
    [It is not on the Council's website. It is LGA best practice to provide this.]
    The Public Interest Test is a general principle that is considered by public bodies when making decisions and includes the seriousness of the matters complained about, the
    amount of resources required to deal with a complaint and the type of remedy available. It is not possible to prescribe in the procedure the public interest test as it will vary on a case by case basis.

26. Para 4 states" All complaints will be treated as confidential to enable a fair process to be followed. The parties to the complaint must not publicise the fact or content or the complaint or the outcome without the agreement of the Monitoring Officer"
    If everything that is the subject of the complaint is documented and in the public domain on social media (eg Twitter) then is it reasonable for a Councillor to expect confidentiality, in terms of the complainant solely publicising that a complaint has been made?
    The principle of confidentiality is to ensure fairness to complainants and Councillors who are the subject of complaints.
27. Not allowing a member of the public to publicise the outcome of a complaint is essentially imposing a Confidentiality Agreement (NDA) on members of the public. Does the Council have legal powers to do this?
    How is this appropriate ethically? How does it help good governance? How does it meet the Nolan principles?
    The principle of confidentiality is to ensure fairness to complainants and Councillors who are the subject of complaints.

01 - VE Sub - PF Bundle 2.pdf

The appointment of Independent Persons was done through a formal recruitment and selection process carried out by the Monitoring Officer and the Head of Legal Services.
Post-Publication clarification dated 20 October 2023 - The recent recruitment process for Independent Persons will require the ratification of those appointments by Full council and it is anticipated that this will be at the next ordinary meeting of Full Council on 14 November.




"Q9. Can the MO confirm that Members have complied with and fulfilled all the actions agreed for the informal resolutions noted in his report? If not, what action has been taken by the MO?
A: A decision notice will set out any action that a member needs to take following a complaint and this will be followed up as appropriate by the Monitoring Officer."


The Monitoring Officer will follow up as appropriate on any actions that a
member needs to take. It would not be appropriate to comment on individual cases.

2. Do the independent persons see the original complaint, or only a summary provided by the monitoring officer?
   Response - The Independent Person will be provided with full details of the original complaint.


4. In the document "Appendix 2 Draft Procedure for Member Complaints" there is an addition of "The parties to the complaint must not publicise the fact or content or the complaint or the outcome without the agreement of the Monitoring Officer". Who proposed this, and what problem are these changes addressing?
   Response - These changes are proposed by the Monitoring Officer to ensure the fairness and confidentiality of the complaints process.

Keith Farley
Do the Committee consider it appropriate that the names and backgrounds of the Independent Persons are not seemingly made available to the Public?
Response - The identity of Independent Persons is confidential to ensure that they are able to maintain their independence.

Public forum 3rd

There is a requirement to appoint an IP and consult with them where a complaint is investigated.
There is a discretion to consult with an IP in all other circumstances, including initial analysis of a

complaint.
The Council consults an independent person to provide advice on the assessment of
complaints. There have been no complaints that have required an investigation in the last 5 years.
