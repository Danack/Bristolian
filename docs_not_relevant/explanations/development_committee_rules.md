## TL:DR

In 2019, there was a proposal from the chairs of the Development Committees [to require a deferral](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s34769/13%20-%20Appendix%202%202.pdf) rather than outright refusal.  

That proposal didn't reach the BCC constitution.

In 2020, there was a [proposal to strongly push Councillors to defer rather than refuse](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s49010/3_App2%20-%20DC%20CoC.pdf) (see page 16), but it doesn't appear to require that deferral. 

The planning department has been acting as if the proposal that was abandoned is actually the rule.

I suspect people just misremembered which one was actually implemented.

## Summary

Some people think that Development Control committees aren't allowed to give a refusal to a planning application in a meeting, instead those committees need to 'defer' refusals for the next meeting.

* At some point in 2019, the chairs of the Development Committees (Don Alexander and Tom Brook) proposed that there should be a 'cooling off' period when a development committee refuses an application.
* A draft of the [proposed changes can be found here](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s34769/13%20-%20Appendix%202%202.pdf).
* This change was proposed to the Audit committee on the 29th July 2019, who said it was a matter for the development committees to decide, so the Audit Committee referred it back to the Development Committees but it's not clear it ever reached them.
* At the [Audit Committee 16 March 2020](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=134&MId=5915&Ver=4) there [was a similar proposal](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s47309/13%20App2%20-%20DC%20CoC.pdf) that strongly encourages a refusal to be deferred to the next meeting, but does not require it.
* At Full Council on the 21st May 2020, the Audit Committee proposal was recommended and approved.

The actual current rules can be found on page 16 of this part of the constitution [Part 5 (D) Code of conduct for members and officers: planning matters ](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/files/documents/3364-part-5-d-code-of-conduct-for-members-and-officers-planning-matters/file)

## Timeline

### 29th July 2019 - [Audit Committee](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=134&MId=3758)

As part of the <a href="https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s34767/13%20-%20Report%20to%20Audit%20re%20plan%20and%20timetable%20for%20changes%20to%20constitution%20v1.3.pdf">Updating the Constitution</a> agenda item, there is a suggestion for a "Cooling off period for the determination of planning decisions"

The [minutes of this meeting](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s41802/29.7.19.pdf) say that:

> The Committee agreed that it was not the best forum to comment on the proposal.

and 

> That the proposal from the Chairs of the Development Control Committees to amend the Committee Procedure Rules to include a ‘cooling off period’ where the Committee was minded to decide a matter otherwise than in accordance with officer recommendations be referred to Development Control Committee members for consideration.

a.k.a. no decision was made about the proposed 'cooling off' period.

### 26th September, 2019 - <a href="https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=133&MId=5930&Ver=4">Growth and Regeneration Scrutiny Commission</a>

Clive Stevens made a <a href="https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/b31766/Public%20Forum%2026%20Sept%2019%2026th-Sep-2019%2018.00%20Growth%20and%20Regeneration%20Scrutiny%20Commission.pdf?T=9">public forum statement</a> which I'm going to quote at length as it accurately describes the problem:

> I was horrified to see on page 31 that a key measure of success of this administration is the percentage of major applications approved. <a href="https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s41563/Performance%20Report%20Quarter%201.pdf">(See DGR313a).</a>
> Major applications are generally approved by Development Committees which are supposed to be independent decisions taken by Councillors based off independent Officer advice.
> 
> My horror comes from the possibility that this measure is putting Planning Officers in a conflict of interest situation. They are supposed to be assessing whether a development meets planning policy but in the back of their mind they know one of the department’s measures of success and possibly even their own personal objective is influencing them to favour approval over and above the principle of sustainable development.
>
> And what if, for example, a Committee refuses an application and it is taken to appeal by the developer. If officers are measured on approval percentage then how much effort will they put into documents that support the Committee’s decision to refuse. That has to meet the test of potential bias and open the Council up to judicial review
> 
> There are huge amounts of money to be made by YTL, L&G and lots of other developers with so much to gain from “subtle” changes to policy. Indeed some in Bristol would be justified in wondering whether both land and now democracy seems to be being sold off to the highest bidder.



### 16th March 2020 - <a href="https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=134&MId=5915">Audit Committee</a> 

There [was a proposal](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s47309/13%20App2%20-%20DC%20CoC.pdf) that strongly encourages a refusal to be deferred to the next meeting, but does not require it.


### 21st May 2020 - <a href="https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=142&MId=8366">Full Council</a>
  
There are three documents for this item:

* [Constitution Update: Members Code of Conduct for Development Control Committees](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s49008/1_Members%20CoC%20for%20DC%20Committees%2013%20FC%20AGM%20report.pdf)
* [Appendix 1 Part 5(d) Code of conduct for members and officers - planning matters](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s49009/2_App%201%20Part%205d%20Code%20of%20conduct%20for%20members%20and%20officers%20-%20planning%20matters.pdf)
* [Appendix 2 - Good practice protocol for planning](https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s49010/3_App2%20-%20DC%20CoC.pdf)

The first document is the overview, near the bottom of the second page, there is:

> - Changes to appendix 1 of the Code concerning the situation where the decision of the Committee is to overturn officer recommendations
> - The addition of a new appendix 2 detailing the debate and decision process

The [BCC constitution published in May 2020](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/files/documents/3364-part-5-d-code-of-conduct-for-members-and-officers-planning-matters/file) contains the new wording as proposed in the 16th March 2020 Audit Committee, not the change proposed by the chairs of the Development Committees.
