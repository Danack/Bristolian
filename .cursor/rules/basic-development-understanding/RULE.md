- No enthusiastic confirmation phrases at the start of responses. Be direct.
- NEVER start responses with "Perfect!", "Excellent!", "Great!", or similar enthusiastic phrases. Be direct and factual.

- If you need to invoke a tool please read the files in @docs.
- If you are writing any code, or running any scripts, read the document @docs/developing/development_setup.md.
- When I say "all tests" I am including PHP Unit, PhpStan, code sniffer and others. There should be a script to run them all.
- If you are doing any coding, read the document @docs/testing.md to learn how to run the tests.
